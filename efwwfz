    //We will be using System.out.println and System.out.print throughout the year. Try using both below to see what the difference is!






    //ANSWER: 

    int n = 0;
    long m = 0;
    boolean yes = true;

    for(int i = 1; i < 100; i++){
      if(n % 2 != 0){
        System.out.println(n);
      }else{

    }


    //MATH TIME!

    //What are the math operators that we can use?
    //+ - * / %

    //Try doing some math operations with numbers. How can we check to see if the math worked?

    //Create codes that will print the following:

    //Odd integers from 1 to 100, inclusive of both



    //All multiples of 3 from 1 to 100




    //Starting at 1000, print on the same line (with a - [hypthen] between each) all of the numbers that end in 0 going down to 0
  }
